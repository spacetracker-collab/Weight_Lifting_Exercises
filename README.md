**Reason for this application**

I had chest pain. The doctor said it was just fibromyalgia and recommended walking. Instead, I went on Facebook and asked for suggestions and I got SQUATS (Systematic Quantified Aesthetic Training System) recommendation. It is now called Fittr. I chose Najid as my mentor for  12 week online program and strictly followed the diet and weight lifting that wa recommended. I lost a lot of weight in just 8 weeks. This is not meant to be replicable without a mentor.
